# SCI Patient Education

This is a web app designed to be a quick reference for patients with spinal cord injuries and their families. It uses the [Framework7.io](https://framework7.io) library. Users with little to no experience can:

1. download the app from a code repository
2. customize the content
3. create new content and features
4. push these new features back to the repository to contribute to the project.

If you want the full suite of reference apps installed complete with a launch page, you probably want the [OpenRehab superproject](https://github.com/gmarzloff/OpenRehab). See **Basic Installation** in that README.
