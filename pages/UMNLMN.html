            <p>In order to move, the brain sends messages through nerves called Upper Motor Neurons (UMN) that travel down the spinal
            cord. These nerves communicate to other nerves that exit the spinal cord called Lower Motor Neurons (LMN), carrying
            the message to muscles to move.</p>

            <p>Injuries to the spinal cord (above level L1 when the cord ends and the cauda equina begins) are called Upper
                Motor Neuron injuries. In these injuries, the connection from the brain to the muscles is broken and the
                muscles under the level of the injury are either partially or fully paralyzed.</p>

        <div class="block-title">Lower Motor Neuron</div>
        <div class="block-strong">
            <p>Injuries below the spinal cord that affect the cauda equina or conus medullaris are called Lower Motor Neuron
                injuries. Muscles below the level of injury are also either partially or fully paralyze, and are loose with
                inactive reflexes are not active.</p>
