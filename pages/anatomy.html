        <div class="block-title">What does the spinal cord look like?</div>
        <div class="block-strong">
            <p>The spinal cord is a tight collection of nerves that runs from the brain down to the low back. It is protected
                by 29 backbones (vertebrae) that make up the spine </p>
            <p>The vertebrae are labeled into 4 groups based on location:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>7 cervical (neck)</li>
                <li>12 thoracic (the chest)</li>
                <li>5 lumbar (the low back)</li>
                <li>5 fused sacral bones (low back to the tailbone)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The spinal cord ends at about the L1 level at a structure called the conus medullaris. Then there are nerves
                that continue down in a looser arrangement called the cauda equina, in latin meaning "horse's tail"
            </p>
            <p>From each verteba, spinal nerves exit the spinal cord or cauda equina to send and receive messages to and from
                the body</p>
            <p>The first nerve to exit the spinal cord is called C1, C for cervical. Then C2, C3 and so on until C8</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cervical: C1-8</li>
                <li>Thoracic: T1-12</li>
                <li>Lumbar: L1-5</li>
                <li>Sacral: S1-5</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The last nerves at the bottom of the spinal cord are S4-5</p>
