            <p>The spinal cord is a tight collection of nerves that runs from the brain down to the low back. It is protected
                by 33 backbones (vertebrae) that make up the spine </p>
            <p>The vertebrae are labeled into 5 groups based on location:</p>

            <p>Vertebrae are numbered by group and number counting from the top of the spine to the bottom</p>
            <p>The spinal cord ends at about the L1 level at a structure called the conus medullaris. Then there are nerves that
                continue down in a looser arrangement called the cauda equina, in latin meaning "horse's tail"
            </p>
            <p>From each verteba, spinal nerves exit the spinal cord or cauda equina to send and receive messages to and from the
                body</p>
            <p>The first nerve to exit the spinal cord is called C1, C for cervical. Then C2, C3 and so on until C8</p>
