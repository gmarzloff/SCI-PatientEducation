        <div class="block">
            <p>The spinal cord is a tight collection of nerves that runs from the brain down to the low back. It is protected
                by 29 backbones (vertebrae) that make up the spine. The vertebrae are labeled into 4 groups based on location:
                7 cervical (neck), 12 thoracic (the chest), 5 lumbar (the low back), and 5 fused sacral bones (low back to
                the tailbone). The spinal cord ends at about the L1 level at a structure called the conus medullaris. Then
                there are nerves that continue down in a looser arrangement called the cauda equina, in latin meaning "horse's
                tail." From each verteba, spinal nerves exit the spinal cord or cauda equina to send and receive messages
                to and from the body.</p>
            <p>The first nerve to exit the spinal cord is called C1, C for cervical. Then C2, C3 and so on until C8</p>
            <p>Cervical: C 1-8</p>
            <p>Thoracic: T 1-12</p>
            <p>Lumbar: L 1-5</p>
            <p>Sacral: S 1-5</p>
            <p>The last nerves at the bottom of the spinal cord are S4-5</p>
