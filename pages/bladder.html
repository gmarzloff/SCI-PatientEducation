            <li>Urine is made in the kidneys, then travels down to the bladder in 2 tubes called ureters</li>
            <li>The bladder is made of a muscular wall that stretches and fills with urine as it is made</li>
            <li>As the muscle of the bladder stretches, signals are sent to the brain that the bladder is filling in order to prepare to empty the 
                bladder</li>
            <li>Then, if it's an appropriate time, signals are sent back to the bladder to contract or squeeze
                the bladder muscle</li>
            <li>The urine leaves the bladder through a small ring of muscle called a sphincter which is a gate-keeper: it stays
                tight to keep urine in, and relaxes to allow urine out</li>
            <p>In order to get all the urine out of the bladder</p>
                <ul><li>The bladder muscle must contract</li>
                <li>The sphincter
                must relax</li>
                </ul>  
            <p>The signals to coordinate these two actions are disrupted in SCI in different ways based on if the injury is

            <p>The goal for management is to stay dry, empty the bladder, and prevent problems like infections or kidney damage</p>
