                    How the bladder works</div>
                <div class="block-strong">
                    <p>Urine is made in the kidneys, then travels down to the bladder in 2 tubes called ureters</p>
                    <p>The bladder is made of a muscular wall that stretches and fills with urine as it is made</p>
                    <p>As the muscle of the bladder stretches, signals are sent to the brain that the bladder is filling in
                        order to prepare to empty the bladder
                    </p>
                    <p>Then, if it's an appropriate time, signals are sent back to the bladder to contract or squeeze the bladder
                        muscle
                    </p>
                    <p>The urine leaves the bladder through a small ring of muscle called a sphincter which is a gate-keeper:
                        it stays tight to keep urine in, and relaxes to allow urine out</p>
                    <p>In order to get all the urine out of the bladder</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The bladder muscle must contract</li>
                        <li>The sphincter must relax</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The signals to coordinate these two actions are disrupted in SCI in different ways based on if the injury
                        is
                        <a href="/UMNLMN/">Upper Motor Neuron (UMN)</a> or

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">The goal for management is to stay dry, empty the bladder, and prevent problems like infections or

                    <p>The bladder is small, tight, and the muscle is overactive, called <a href="/spasticity/">spastic</a></p>
                    <p>Even a small amount of urine causes the bladder muscle to squeeze and push urine out without warning</p>
                    <p>The signals that the brain sends down to keep the urine inside and allow urine to be stored in the bladder
                        do not reach the bladder</p>
                    <p>The sphincter (gatekeeper) muscle is also tight and spastic and the signals from the brain to 
                     relax it to allow urine out may be disrupted</p>
                    <p>Therefore as urine is made, the bladder continuously tries to squeeze it out, sometimes reaching resistance
                        from the sphincter which is closed tight</p>
                    <p>Urine leaks when the pressure in the bladder is more than the strength of the sphincter muscle</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>That can cause a very high pressure environment in the bladder which can be dangerous</li>
                        <li>If the pressure is high enough, some urine can be pushed backwards to the ureters and kidneys, causing
                            kidney damage</li>
