            <li>Urine is made in the kidneys, then travels down to the bladder in 2 tubes called ureters</li>
            <li>The bladder stores and then releases urine when ready</li>
            <li>The bladder is made of a muscular wall that stretches and fills slowly with urine during the day as we drink
                and make urine</li>
            <li>As the muscle of the bladder stretches, signals are sent to the brain so we can feel that we have to empty our
                bladder</li>
            <li>Then, if it's the right time and appropriate to go, signals are sent back to the bladder to contract or squeeze
                the bladder muscle</li>
            <li>The urine leaves the bladder through a small ring of muscle called a sphincter which is a gate-keeper: it stays
                tight to keep urine in, and relaxes to allow urine out</li>
            <li>In order to get all the urine out of the bladder, the bladder muscle must contract and the sphincter
                must relax</li>
            <li>The signals to coordinate these two actions are disrupted in SCI in different ways based on if the injury is
                Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) or Lower Motor Neuron (LMN)</li>
            <li>The goal for management is to stay dry, empty the bladder, and prevent problems like infections or kidney damage</li>
