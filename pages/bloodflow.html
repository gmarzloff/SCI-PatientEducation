                <div class="block-strong">
                    <p>After a spinal cord injury, some people have lower than usual blood pressure because the messages the
                        body usually uses to maintain a normal blood pressure are disrupted. There can be quick drops in
                        blood pressure when sitting or standing up called
                        <span class="bold">orthostatic hypotension</span>. "Orthostatic" means based on position, "hypo-" means low, and "-tension"
                        is referring to the blood pressure in the body. </p>

                    <p>Orthostatic hypotension can cause:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dizziness</li>
                        <li>Light-headedness</li>
                        <li>Blurry vision or seeing starts</li>
                        <li>Confusion</li>

                    <p>Speak with a medical provider to discuss orthostatic hypotension as it can cause severe symptoms and

                    <p>Some common ways to address orthostatic hypotension are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lie down to immediately help blood pressure go up</li>

                        <li>Compression stockings</li>
                        <li>Using a tilt table to gradually train the body to better maintain blood pressure and adjust to position changes</li>
                        <li>Increasing water and salt intake</li>
                        <li>Medication may be given based on a medical provider's clinical decision</li>

            Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</div>
        <div class="block-strong">

            <p>If muscles in the legs are weak or not functioning, risk for blood clot, known as a
                <span class="bold">deep vein thrombosis</span>, forming in the leg can increase in the period immediately after injury.</p>
            <p>A DVT is a blood clot that stops the return of blood back up to the heart, so because of the block blood backs
                up and there is usually swelling in the leg.</p>
            <p>Blood clots can be especially dangerous if a part of the clot breaks off and travels up to the lung, causing
                a pulmonary embolism. This can cause difficulty breathing, and can even block someone's ability to breathe
                altogether, causing death.</p>

            <p>It is recommended that medication to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is given for at least 8 weeks after injury
                This medication can either be injected under the skin or given as a pill by mouth.</p>
