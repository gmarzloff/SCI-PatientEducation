                  <p>The colon (large intestine) is the part of the bowel where nutrients are absorbed from digested food to form
                    stool
                  </p>
                  <p>Stool is squeezed through the colon by muscles in its walls that work by reflex: when the colon wall is stretched
                    by digested food, it squeezes around the food pushing it through</p>
                  <p>The rectum is the last part of the colon where the stool stays until ready for a bowel movement</p>
                  <p>The anus, or rectal opening, is made of a sphincter muscle which can be tight to keep stool in,

              <p>Spastic, tight sphincter muscle that keeps the anus closed, holding stool in</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Physical stimulation: using a finger to stretch the sphincter muscle and wall of the rectum to cause it to open and push stool out</li>

              <p>This is done with a regular bowel routine that could consist of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bulking agent: medication given to bulk up the stool so it is less likely to leak out</li>
                <li>May have to perform bowel routine more frequently, 2 times a day or at least every day</li>
                <li>Everyone is different, so speak with your medical provider to create the best plan</li>
