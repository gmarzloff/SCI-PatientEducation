            <p>We breathe to bring oxygen into the lungs and transfer it into the blood where it travels to the body to fuel

                to the lungs and breathed out</p>
            <p>Signals from the brain to the breathing muscles can be affected depending on the level and

            <p>Because of difficulty coughing, the lungs can become congested</p>
            <p>Congested lungs can lead to pneumonia (lung infection)</p>
            <p>Shallow breaths can lead to atelectasis, with is a partial collapse of the lung because air isn't reaching that

            <p>Talk to your medical provider for the best ways to address problems that arise for you</p>
            <p>Some common ways to deal with breathing problems are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty with cough</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chest percussion: cupped hand taps along the back to loosen secretions in the lung</li>
                    <li>Assisted cough: While coughing, someone assists by presses into the stomach under the ribcage to give
                        more force to the cough</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Breathing exercises</li>
                    <li>Training accessory breathing muscles (muscles in the front of the neck and chest) to help in breathing</li>
