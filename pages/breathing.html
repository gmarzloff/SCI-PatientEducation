            <p>We breath to bring oxygen into the lungs and transfer it into the blood where it travels to the body to fuel
                    all organs. The organs release their waste product, carbon dioxide, into the blood where it is carried
                    back to the lungs and breathed out</p>

            <p>Because of difficulty coughing, the lungs can become congested</p>
            <p>Congested lungs can lead to pneumonia (lung infection) or atelectasis, with is a partial collapse of the lung
                becasue air isn't reaching that area</p>
