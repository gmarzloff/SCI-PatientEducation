        <div class="block-strong">
            <p>An injury is considered "complete" if the very bottom of the spinal cord does not receive any motor signals from
                the brain (no movement) or send any signals up from the body to the brain (no sensation or feeling). The
                bottom of the spinal cord is level S4-5 and controls the motor activity and sensation at the anus.</p>

        <div class="block-title">Incomplete Injury</div>
        <div class="block-strong">
            <p>An "incomplete" SCI is any injury to the spinal cord that still allows some sensory or motor function at the
                bottom of the spinal cord, S4-5. There is a large variation in the amount of signals that can be sent through
                a spinal cord injury.   Strength and sensation below a SCI can vary from not present to almost fully intact</p>
