                <p>An "incomplete" SCI is any injury to the spinal cord that still allows some sensory or motor function at the
                    bottom of the spinal cord, S4-5. There is a large variation in the amount of signals that can be sent through
                    a spinal cord injury.   Strength and sensation below a SCI can vary from not present to almost fully intact</p>
