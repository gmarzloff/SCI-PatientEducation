        <div class="block-title">What is Spasticity?</div>
        <div class="block-strong">
            <p>Spasticity can occur in
                <a href="/UMNLMN/">Upper Motor Neuron</a> spinal cord injuries.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spasticity after SCI is when muscles contract (tighten) or move on their own without signals coming from
                    the brain telling the muscle to move. This happens because of reflexes </li>
                <li>A reflex is, for example, what is tested by doctors when the knee is tapped and the leg kicks </li>
                <li>Signals are sent from area tapped (the muscle) to the spinal cord and back, causing the muscle to move</li>
                <li>No signals are sent to the brain, so reflexes can work even if there is a spinal cord injury</li>
                <li>All muscles have reflexes all the time, but there are signals sent from the brain to the muscles to keep
                    the reflexes under control</li>
                <li>After a spinal cord injury, the signals keeping reflexes controlled are blocked so reflexes can be overactive,
                    and muscles can be jumpy or "spastic," moving on their own</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Spasticity can be present in arm, torso, and leg muscles, but also in the muscles of internal organs, like the
                <a href="/bladder/">bladder</a> and
                <a href="/bowel/">bowel</a>.</p>

        <div class="block-title">Is spasticity good or bad?</div>
        <div class="block-strong">
            <p>Spasticity just happens to some people after spinal cord injury - it is neither good nor bad!</p>
            <p>There are some benefits to spasticity:</p>


            <ul>
                <li>Spasticity may help maintain muscle size and bone strength because muscles are contracting and moving</li>
                <li>Spasticity helps circulate blood from the lower body back up to the heart because contracting leg muscles
                    squeeze the veins in the legs carrying blood</li>
                <li>More spasms can be a sign that something is irritating the body, so increased spasticity can act as a warning
                    to address the issue and prevent a problem</li>
                <li>Spasticity can be used to tighten a muscle for support when trying to perform a physical task, such as transfer
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are also some drawbacks to spasticity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spasticity can be uncomfortable or cause cramping or pain</li>
                <li>It can interfere with activities of daily living like transfers, getting dressed, or driving</li>
                <li>Spasticity can sometimes cause so much tone in a muscle that it can stop the joint from moving fully. This
                    is called a contracture.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="block-title">What to do if Spasticity is becoming a problem</div>
        <div class="block-strong">
            <p>Talk to your doctor to discuss whether treating spasticity is right for you</p>
            <p>Usually stretching and 'range of motion' exercises are the first recommmendations</p>
            <p>If spasticity is still a problem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are medications that can be taken by mouth</li>
                <li>Injections can be given directly into the spastic muscles</li>
                <li>Medication can be given intrathecally - into the spinal fluid - through a pump that is placed by a surgeon
                    under the skin. Doctors will refill the pump regularly depending on the dose of medication needed</li>
                <li>Surgery can be performed on the nerves to stop the reflex signals to the muscles</li>
            </ul>
