                    <p>The nerves outside of the spinal cord that connect to muscles can still work without signals from the brain.
                            This is called a reflex. A reflex is, for example, what is tested by doctors when the knee is tapped and
                            the leg kicks - no signals are sent to the brain, only from the muscle to the spinal cord and back. In those
                            with spinal cord injury, reflexes can be overactive, and muscles can be very jumpy or "spastic," moving on
                            their own.</p>
                        <p>Spasticity can be present in those with UMN injuries in their arm and leg muscles, but also in the muscles of
                            their internal organs, like the bladder and bowel.</p>
