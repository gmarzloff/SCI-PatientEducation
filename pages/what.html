        <div class="block">
            <p>The spinal cord sends signals from the brain to the body to move, and from the body to the brain to feel. It
                also helps to coordinate and regulate bodily functions such as the bowel, bladder, and blood circulation.
                The signals through the spinal cord are disrupted after a spinal cord injury (SCI) depending on the level
                and the extent of the injury. Many aspects of daily living, bodily functions, and development
                can be affected.
